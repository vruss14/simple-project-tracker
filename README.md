# Project Tracker

A front-end project tracker that helps freelance web developers efficiently manage their workflow.

## Description

This website utilizes various front-end technologies and libraries, including HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and the jQuery UI library. Users can enter project information by filling out a form (displayed on a modal), then that information is dynamically added to the table on the page. After a user completes a project, the user can then delete it from the table.

Building this project was a good reminder that information can be deleted based on considering a button's class, and that particular button's relation to other parts of the DOM (in this case, the table row that it is in). While I have become accustomed to deleting data through MySQL or MongoDB, it was interesting to remember that this option is a good front-end solution.

A couple ideas for future development include:

- Polishing the UI
- Turning the website into a full-stack application that uses a database
